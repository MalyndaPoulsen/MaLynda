                    <h2>Experience Narrative</h2>
                    <p>Prior to my career as a professor of art, I was an Administrative Assistant, and later Program Assistant
                        for The Idaho Commission on the Arts. I also worked as a bill collector for Sears Credit Center,
                        and a retail supervisor for companies such as Starbucks and Van Heusen. Regardless of the organization
                        I was employed by, each of these positions required superior administrative abilities, strong communication
                        skills, excellent customer service, and the ability to manage time, multitask, and meet deadlines.
                        They also required the ability to quickly assess complex situations, evaluate alternatives, and shift
                        priorities within a dynamic and fast-paced environment.</p>
