        <h2>EXPERIENCE NARRATIVE</h2>
        <div class="col-xs-7">
            <p>
                With over 20 years of experience in design, web development, education, and retail management, my diverse skill set make
                me unique and highly adaptable. My portfolio demonstrates visual design thinking and proficiency in a variety
                of formats. I am extremely adept at Photoshop and familiar with the Adobe Suite software, understand responsive
                design, and can design for both mobile and web applications, with or without bootstrap.</p>
            <p>
                I am quick to learn new technologies and am continually adding new skills and languages to my repertoire.</p>
            <p>The following are just a few of my strengths:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    I am proficient in HTML/Javascript/CSS/ Bootstrap/Angular/jQuery, and am able to prototype in these mediums.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I use GitHub for version control.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I have a strong understanding of “Object-Oriented Programming.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    I am collaboratively minded and able to both embrace SCRUM methodology and work in an “agile” environment.
                </li>

                <li>
                    I am a conceptual thinker, skilled in creative problem solving, particularly when geared towards “result oriented” outcomes.
                </li>

                <li>
                    I am an excellent communicator (visually, verbally, and in writing).
                </li>
                <li>
                    I am detail-oriented, organized, and able to maintain a positive attitude in stressful situations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I possess exceptional drawing skills.
                </li>
                <li>I demonstrate integrity and accountability in all that I do.</li>
            </ul>


            
                <h2>EXPERIENCE NARRATIVE</h2>
                <p>Prior to my career as a professor of art, I was an Administrative Assistant, and later Program Assistant
                    for The Idaho Commission on the Arts. I also worked as a bill collector for Sears Credit Center, and
                    a retail supervisor for companies such as Starbucks and Van Heusen. Regardless of the organization I
                    was employed by, each of these positions required superior administrative abilities, strong communication
                    skills, excellent customer service, and the ability to manage time, multitask, and meet deadlines. They
                    also required the ability to quickly assess complex situations, evaluate alternatives, and shift priorities
                    within a dynamic and fast-paced environment.
